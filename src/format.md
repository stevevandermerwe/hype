# Writing a Hype presentation

A presentation is one Markdown file. Edit it with any text tool, then use
`hype check`, `hype render`, and `hype export` to verify and ship it. If the
file is open in the Hype editor, saved edits appear there as long as the editor
has no unsaved changes of its own.

## Layout on disk

```text
my-talk/
  presentation.md
  images/      photos, diagrams, animated GIF/WebP, SVG
  videos/      mp4, m4v, mov, webm, mkv
```

Media is referenced by filename only: `![](city.jpg)` reads `images/city.jpg`
and `![](demo.mp4)` reads `videos/demo.mp4`.

## Front matter

```markdown
---
title: "My talk"
theme: tokyo-night
font: "JetBrains Mono"
---
```

`hype new` writes this for you, along with the theme's `color_*` values.
`hype themes` lists the installed themes. Any `color_*` value can be
overridden with a `#rrggbb` color: `color_background`, `color_foreground`,
`color_accent`, `color_green`, `color_red`, `color_yellow`, `color_magenta`,
`color_cyan`, `color_dark_foreground`.

## Slides

Separate slides with a line holding only `---`, with a blank line on either
side. Slides are 16:9 and text is sized to fit, so say less per slide: a
headline, a few bullets, or one short quote. `hype check` warns when a slide
holds so much that its text shrinks below a readable size.

```ruby

```
````

- `# Headline` is big. Lists, quotes, tables, and inline `code` work.
- `*asterisks*` are italic, `**double**` is bold, `_underscores_` underline.
- Ordinary line breaks stay visible on the slide.
- `<!-- comments -->` are hidden from the slide; use them for speaker notes.
- A `---` inside a code fence does not split the slide.

## Images and video

Each slide takes one image or video. Options go inside the brackets:

| Markdown | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `![](diagram.png)` | Show the whole image |
| `![span](photo.jpg)` | Fill the slide, cropping as needed |
| `![right](diagram.png)` | Image in the right half, text in the left half |
| `![left](diagram.png)` | Image in the left half, text in the right half |
| `![left span](photo.jpg)` | Fill the left half, cropping as needed |
| `![fit](photo.jpg)` | Show the whole image, with any text overlaid |
| `![fit background=#ffffff](diagram.png)` | Fill the space around it with a color |
| `![fit background=blur](portrait.jpg)` | Fill it with a blurred copy of the image |
| `![fit background=auto](portrait.jpg)` | Match the image's edge color |
| `![overlay=0.5](photo.jpg)` | Darken the picture behind text, from 0 to 1 |
| `![loop muted](demo.mp4)` | Loop a video without sound |
| `![autoplay=false](demo.mp4)` | Wait for Space to play the video |
| `![poster=still.png](demo.mp4)` | Show an image from `images/` until it plays |

Text on an image slide is overlaid in white over a slightly darkened picture.
An image with a headline spans the slide unless you say `fit`. For text that
must stay readable beside a picture, say `left` or `right`: the image takes that
half of the slide and the text moves to the other half, so nothing is overlaid.

## Commands

```text
hype new talk/presentation.md --title "My talk" --theme tokyo-night
hype check talk/presentation.md --json     every problem, with slide and line
hype slides talk/presentation.md --json    an outline of the slides
hype render talk/presentation.md --slide 3 -o slide.png
hype render talk/presentation.md -o slides/        every slide, plus slides.json
hype export talk/presentation.md talk.pdf          or talk.pptx
```

Commands need no display. They exit 0 on success and 1 on failure, with errors
on stderr. Render a slide and look at the PNG to judge how it reads.
